Jurassic Park: Trespasser is a video game released in 1998 for Microsoft Windows. The game was billed as a "digital sequel" to the 1997 film The Lost World: Jurassic Park, on which it is based. The player assumes the role of Anne who is the sole survivor of a plane crash on InGen's "Site B" one year after the events of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Anne must escape the remote island by solving puzzles and evading dangerous dinosaurs.
 
The game was ambitious for its time, featuring a realistic physics engine, an open-world environment, and a dynamic soundtrack. However, it was also plagued by technical issues, bugs, and poor performance. The game received mixed reviews from critics and fans, and was a commercial failure.
