The OMSI 2 Add-on Hamburger Buspaket was developed by Darius Bode and published by Aerosoft GmbH. It was released on March 15, 2018 and has received very positive reviews from the OMSI 2 community. The add-on has been praised for its high level of detail, realism, and accuracy. The developer has also provided regular updates and patches to fix any issues and improve the add-on.
 
The buses in the add-on follow the "B2E" operating standard, which is a new dashboard model that was introduced in Hamburg in 2017. The dashboard has a modern design and features a large LCD screen that displays various information such as speed, time, route, destination, and more. The dashboard also has a touch screen that allows the driver to control various functions such as lights, doors, heating, ventilation, and more.
 
The add-on also features true-to-original exterior sliding doors and interior swing doors that open and close realistically. The doors have sensors that detect any obstacles and prevent them from closing. The doors also have sound effects that match the real ones. The add-on also has various advertising liveries that are based on the real ones used by Hamburg's buses. You can choose from different liveries or create your own with the 4K repaint templates.
  
The add-on also features realistic new engine sounds that are recorded from the real buses. You can hear the engine revving, idling, accelerating, and braking. The sounds also change depending on the speed and load of the bus. The add-on also has 4 speed and 6 speed automatic transmissions that have different characteristics and sounds. You can switch between the transmissions with a button on the dashboard.
 
The add-on also supports the special rerouting plans and announcements that are used on the HafenCity map. The rerouting plans are activated when there is a road closure or an event that affects the normal route of the bus. The announcements are made by a voice actor that informs the passengers about the current situation and the alternative route. The announcements are also synchronized with the LCD screen and the destination signs on the bus.
 
The add-on is compatible with other maps and ticketing systems in OMSI 2. You can use the buses on any map that supports OMSI 2 standards and features. You can also use any ticketing system that works with OMSI 2, such as TicketPack, Simple Farebox, or Payware TicketPack. The add-on also has a manual that explains how to use and customize the buses.
