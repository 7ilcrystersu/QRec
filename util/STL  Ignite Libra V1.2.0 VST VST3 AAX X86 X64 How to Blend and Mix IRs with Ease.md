STL â Ignite Libra V1.2.0 is a great plugin for guitarists who want to experiment with different cabinet sounds and create their own signature tone. It is compatible with Windows 7 or higher and requires an iLok account for activation. You can download a free trial version or purchase the full version for $49.99 from the STL website.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use STL â Ignite Libra V1.2.0 to create a custom guitar tone using impulse responses. First, you need to install the plugin on your computer and activate it with your iLok account. Then, you need to load the plugin in your DAW of choice and insert it on a track with a guitar signal. You can use any guitar amp simulator or plugin as the input source, or even a real amp with a DI box.
 
Once you have the plugin loaded, you will see the main interface with eight slots for IR files. You can click on each slot to open the IR browser and select an IR from the included library or your own collection. You can also drag and drop IR files from your computer or DAW into the slots. You can solo or mute each slot to hear how each IR sounds individually or in combination with others.
 
To adjust the parameters of each IR, you can use the knobs and buttons below each slot. You can change the phase, pan, volume, and delay of each IR to create different stereo effects and balance the levels. You can also use the EQ and filter sections to shape the frequency response of each IR. You can switch between low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters and adjust the cutoff frequency and resonance. You can also use the low-shelf, high-shelf, peak, and notch EQ bands to boost or cut specific frequencies.
 
To capture the tone of any amp using the Amp Match function, you need to click on the Amp Match button on the top right corner of the interface. Then, you need to select an input source from the drop-down menu. You can choose between a mic input, a line input, or a loopback input. The mic input allows you to capture the tone of a real amp using a microphone connected to your audio interface. The line input allows you to capture the tone of a real amp using a DI box connected to your audio interface. The loopback input allows you to capture the tone of a virtual amp using a software routing tool such as Soundflower or VB-Audio Cable.
 
Once you have selected an input source, you need to play some chords or notes on your guitar for about 10 seconds while the plugin analyzes the signal. You will see a progress bar on the bottom of the interface indicating how much time is left. When the analysis is done, you will see a message saying "Amp Match Complete". The plugin will then create a custom IR that matches the frequency response of the input signal and load it into one of the slots. You can then use this IR in your mix or export it as a WAV file for later use.
 
STL â Ignite Libra V1.2.0 is a powerful and versatile impulse response mixer that can help you create amazing guitar tones using different cabinet sounds and amp simulations. It is easy to use and offers a lot of options for customization and experimentation. Whether you are looking for a realistic or creative sound, STL â Ignite Libra V1.2.0 can deliver it.
