One of the main tools that Bradshaw uses to help you reconnect with your inner child is the Family of Origin work. This is a process of identifying and understanding the dysfunctional patterns and roles that you learned from your family of origin, and how they affect your current relationships and behaviors. By doing this work, you can become aware of your false beliefs, repressed emotions, and unmet needs, and start to heal them with compassion and acceptance.
 
Another tool that Bradshaw uses is the Inner Child work. This is a process of communicating with your inner child, listening to his or her feelings and needs, and providing him or her with the love, support, and guidance that he or she deserves. By doing this work, you can reclaim your inner child's creativity, spontaneity, playfulness, and joy, and integrate them into your adult self.
 
Bradshaw also offers other exercises and techniques to help you heal your inner child, such as guided meditations, affirmations, journaling, letter writing, role playing, art therapy, and more. He also provides examples and stories from his own life and from his clients' experiences to illustrate his points and inspire you.
 
Volver A Casa is a book that can change your life for the better. It can help you heal your wounds and free yourself from your limitations. It can help you love yourself and others more fully. It can help you create a new home within yourself.
