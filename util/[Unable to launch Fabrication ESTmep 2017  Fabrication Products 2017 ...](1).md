## Features and Benefits of Fabrication ESTmep 2017
 
Some of the features and benefits of Fabrication ESTmep 2017 are:
 
- It uses manufacturer-specific content and patterns to create more realistic and detailed estimates. It also includes Harrison codes and prices for imperial content[^4^].
- It can import models from Revit, Revit MEP, or AutoCAD MEP to extend design intent into fabrication-ready models[^4^].
- It can perform value engineering on services and produce multiple cost/benefit options for clients[^4^].
- It can track project variation and record all adds and omits on a job to support traceability and accountability[^4^].
- It can use the color-coded cost analysis tool to visually define the cost of duct and pipe[^4^].
- It can export and import data to and from Fabrication CADmep and Fabrication CAMduct for seamless detailing and fabrication workflows[^4^].

## Integration with Revit and AutoCAD
 
Fabrication ESTmep 2017 can work with Revit and AutoCAD to provide a comprehensive solution for MEP design, estimation, detailing, and fabrication. Some of the ways that Fabrication ESTmep 2017 integrates with Revit and AutoCAD are:

- It can import Revit models into Fabrication ESTmep 2017 for bid generation using underlays and Design Line technology[^4^].
- It can export Fabrication ESTmep 2017 models back to Revit as LOD 400 fabrication parts for coordination and documentation[^2^].
- It can use AutoCAD MEP models as a basis for creating fabrication-intent models in Fabrication CADmep 2017[^4^].
- It can use AutoCAD commands and tools to modify and manipulate Fabrication CADmep 2017 models[^4^].
