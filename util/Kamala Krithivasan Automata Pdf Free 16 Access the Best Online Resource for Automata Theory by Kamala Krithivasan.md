The book is available in both print and digital formats, and can be accessed online for free from various sources[^1^] [^2^].
 
If you are interested in learning more about formal languages, automata theory and computation, or want to refresh your knowledge on the topic, you might want to give this book a try. It is a valuable resource for students, teachers, researchers, and practitioners alike.
  
One of the main features of the book is that it covers both the classical and the modern aspects of automata theory and computation. The book starts with the preliminaries of sets, relations, functions, logic, and proofs, and then introduces the concepts of grammars, languages, and automata. The book then explores the properties and limitations of different types of automata and grammars, such as regular, context-free, context-sensitive, and recursively enumerable. The book also discusses the notions of decidability, undecidability, reducibility, and completeness, and shows how they relate to various problems in computation.
 
The book then moves on to the topics of time and space complexity, and introduces the classes of P, NP, NP-complete, NP-hard, co-NP, PSPACE, L, NL, and NC. The book also explains the concepts of polynomial-time hierarchy, alternation, interactive proofs, probabilistic computation, parallel computation, and circuit complexity. The book also presents some examples of intractable problems and some techniques for coping with them.
 
The last part of the book deals with some recent trends and applications of automata theory and computation in emerging fields such as bioinformatics and nanotechnology. The book introduces the models of DNA computing and membrane computing, and shows how they can be used to solve some computational problems. The book also discusses some new models of computation such as quantum computing and cellular automata.
